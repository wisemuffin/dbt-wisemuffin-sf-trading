# dbt_trading

This is built from snowflakes quick start [Accelerating Data Engineering with Snowflake & dbt CLI](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/data_engineering_with_dbt_cli/index.html?index=..%2F..index#1)

*dbt features demoed:*
- custom schema naming
- query tagging
- basic incremental model (append only) - models/l30_mart/fct_trading_pnl.sql as the source data is live this is easy to show.
- dbt_utils.union_relations - see models/l20_transform/tfm_book.sql which unions two manually uploaded (seeds) trading books.

*snowflake features demoed*
- uses live data market data shared on snowflake

*sources*
-  Knoema Dataset Catalog table: daily exchange rates  
-  Knoema Dataset Catalog table: daily US trading history

### query tagging

if you go in Snowflake UI and click â€˜History' icon on top, you are going to see all SQL queries run on Snowflake account(successful, failed, running etc) and clearly see what dbt model this particular query is related to:

### custom schema naming

By default, dbt is [generating a schema name](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas) by appending it to the target schema environment name(dev, prod). In dbt_trading I show you a quick way to override this macro, making our schema names to look exactly the same between dev and prod databases.
